# Luminol

Luminol is an experimental remake of the RPG Maker XP editor in Rust with love ❤️.

Luminol targets wasm and native builds with eframe. Luminol also temporarily uses (Rusty Object Notation)[https://github.com/ron-rs/ron] (`.ron`) for serialization. 
Marshal `.rxdata` is planned, and a custom `.lumina` format is also planned.

You can obtain RON versions of RPG Maker XP data using [rmxp_extractor](https://rubygems.org/gems/rmxp_extractor).

## Running luminol

wasm builds are deployed to [luminol.dev](https://luminol.dev/#dev).

native release builds are planned when Luminol is mostly usable.
